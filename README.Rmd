# naflex: Flexible options for missing values

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dannyparsons/naflex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dannyparsons/naflex)
<!-- badges: end -->

The `naflex` R package provides greater flexibility for dealing with missing values than the `na.rm = TRUE/FALSE` option available in most summary functions in R.

Most summary functions in R e.g. `mean`, provide the option for the two extremes:
- calculate the summary ignoring all missing values, `na.rm = TRUE`, or
- require no missing values for the summary to be calculated, `na.rm = FALSE`

In many applications something in between these two extremes is often appropriate. For example, you may wish to give a summary statistic if less than `10%` of values are missing. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Guidelines on the Calculation of Climate Normals<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> recommends that a monthly mean value calculated from daily values should be calculated as long as there are no more than `10` missing values and no more than `4` consecutive missing values in the month.

`naflex` provides helper functions to facilitate this flexibility for dealing with missing values.

In particular `naflex` provides four types of missing value checks:
- a maximum proportion of missing values allowed
- a maximum number of missing values allowed
- a maximum number of consecutive missing values allowed, and
- a minimum number of non-missing values required.
